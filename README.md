## 🚀 Features

  * **Automated OS Detection**: Intelligently identifies your operating system (macOS or Ubuntu) to run the correct setup scripts.
  * **One-Command Setup**: A single `make install` command orchestrates the entire installation process.
  * **Prerequisite Installation**: Automatically installs essential tools if they are missing:
      * **Python 3.11**: Ensures the correct Python version is available for the ADK.
      * **Docker & Docker Compose**: Installs and configures the containerization tools required by watsonx Orchestrate.
  * **Isolated Python Environment**: Creates a local Python virtual environment (`venv`) to keep dependencies clean and project-specific.
  * **Orchestrate ADK Installation**: Prompts for and installs your desired version of the `ibm-watsonx-orchestrate` ADK into the virtual environment.
  * **Environment Configuration**: Seamlessly integrates with a `.env` file for secure management of your API keys and credentials.
  * **Simple Makefile Workflow**: Provides clear, high-level commands for installation, running, and cleanup, with a self-documenting `help` target.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your local watsonx Orchestrate development environment up and running in minutes.

### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

  * **Git**: To clone the repository.
  * **Make**: To run the installation commands. This is pre-installed on most macOS and Linux systems.

### 2\. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruslanmv/Installer-Watsonx-Orchestrate.git
cd Installer-Watsonx-Orchestrate
```

### 3\. Configure Your Environment

The installer requires a `.env` file in the project root to configure your IBM credentials.

**A.** Create a file named `.env` in the `Installer-Watsonx-Orchestrate` directory.

**B.** Copy one of the templates below into your `.env` file, depending on your account type.

**Template for a watsonx Orchestrate Account:**

```env
# For watsonx Orchestrate (SaaS) accounts
WO_DEVELOPER_EDITION_SOURCE=orchestrate
WO_INSTANCE=https://api.us-east.watson-orchestrate.ibm.com/instances/your-instance-id
WO_API_KEY=your-orchestrate-api-key
```

**Template for a watsonx.ai Account:**

```env
# For watsonx.ai (BYOA) accounts on IBM Cloud
WO_DEVELOPER_EDITION_SOURCE=myibm
WO_ENTITLEMENT_KEY=your-entitlement-key
WATSONX_APIKEY=your-watsonx-api-key
WATSONX_SPACE_ID=your-watsonx.ai-space-id
```

**C.** Replace the placeholder values (`your-...`) with your actual credentials.

### 4\. Run the Installer

With your `.env` file configured, run the main installation command from the project root.

```bash
make install
```

The script will detect your OS, install any missing prerequisites, and guide you through selecting an ADK version. This process may take several minutes.

## 🛠️ Usage Workflow

Once the installation is complete, your environment is ready. The `Makefile` provides a simple workflow for starting, managing, and stopping your environment.

### 1\. Activate the Virtual Environment

Before running any commands, you **must** activate the isolated Python environment. This only needs to be done once per terminal session.

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

> You can confirm it's active by seeing `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### 2\. Start the Server

Start the watsonx Orchestrate server in the background.

```bash
make start
```

### 3\. Add and Import Your Skills

Place your custom tool (Python or OpenAPI YAML files) and agent (`.yaml`) files into the `/tools` and `/agents` directories, respectively. If these directories do not exist, the import step will be skipped.

Once your files are in place, run:

```bash
make run
```

This command automatically finds and imports all your tools and agents, and will prompt you to start the chat UI, and finally wait and then you can enter to your local WatsonX orchestrate.
[http://localhost:3000/chat-lite](http://localhost:3000/chat-lite)

### 4\. Stop the Server

To stop the server and any related Docker containers without removing them, use:

```bash
make stop
```

### 5\. Full Cleanup (Optional)

To stop and completely remove all containers and Docker images from your host, use the purge command. **Warning**: This is a destructive action and will require you to re-download images later.

```bash
make purge
```
